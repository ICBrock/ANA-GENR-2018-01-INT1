This documents summarises the framework that has been set up to support
the publication of documents by the ATLAS Collaboration.
While the emphasis is on papers published in refereed journals,
the system also supports internal documents and other public documents
such as Conference and Public notes.

The FENCE framework is used as a backbone of the whole setup
and is also used to interface the web-based tracking of the status of
an analysis with the documentation in \gitlab.
Extensive use is made of the Continuous Integration tools available in \gitlab
to ensure that documents can easily be submitted to arXiv and journals
as soon as they have been approved by the collaboration.

The system described in this document is now used to accompany
the whole of a physics analysis from the expression of interest of groups
that are interested in participating to the final journal publication.
It also includes the generation of the appropriate author list 
(including processing the proof-reading).

The tools are used by the whole of the collaboration and
minimise the amount of manual work required for repetitive procedures,
easing the workload of authors, editorial boards, management and the Physics Office.
At the same time all documents (and talks) connected to an analysis can now be accessed
from a central tool.
