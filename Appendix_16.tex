Mathematically, the Levenshtein distance between two strings a,b of length |a| and |b| respectively is given by lev a,b(|a|,|b|) where

Where 1(ai$\neq$ bj) is equal to 0 when ai = bj and equal to 1 otherwise, and leva,b(i,j) is the distance between the first i characters of a and the first j characters of b.
