\begin{itemize}
\item Previous authorlist workflow:
AFS, script and problems.

\item New authorlist workflow:
Illustrating this new workflow, at Paper Phase 1, when an Authorlist is created a commit is done in Paper repository adding the first version of the Authorlist files in all available formats. At Phase 2, if the Authorlist has a new change, like a new exception, a new commit will be done, substituting the previous version of the Authorlist files.
In summary: Gitlab will store the last updated version of the Authorlist files.
Similarly to the interface used nowadays on the Web, Glance has an interface listing all author list already created in all available formats. The difference with the old Web is that some will point to AFS (old archived author lists) and some will point to Gitlab (newly generated author lists through Glance).
