\AtlasAbstract{%
  The ATLAS Collaboration develops and uses web systems and tools, defines methods, establishes procedures and organizes advisory groups to manage the publication processes of scientific papers, conference papers and public notes.
  The so-called Phase 0 system was implemented using the FENCE framework and is integrated into the CERN Gitlab software repository, to automatically configure workspaces where the analysis can be documented and used by the analysis team and managed by the conveners.
  Continuous integration is used to guide the authors on using the accurate format while writing papers to be submitted to scientific journals.
  The ATLAS Physics and Committees Office provide support to the researchers and facilitate each phase of a publication process, allowing authors to focus on the article contents that describe the results and discoveries of the ATLAS experiment.
