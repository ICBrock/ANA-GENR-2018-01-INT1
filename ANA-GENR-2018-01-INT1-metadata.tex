\AtlasAbstract{%
  The ATLAS Experiment develops and uses Web systems and tools, defines methods, establishes procedures and organize advisory groups to manage the publication processes of scientific papers, conference papers and public notes. The Phase 0 system was implemented using the FENCE framework and is integrated to the Gitlab software to automatically configure workspaces where the analysis can be written, reviewed by a collaborative team. Continuous integration is used to guide the authors on using the accurate format while writing papers to be submitted to scientific Journals. The ATLAS Physics Office directives promote communication among researchers and supports each phase of a publication process, allowing authors to focus on the article contents that describe the results and discoveries of the ATLAS experiment.
