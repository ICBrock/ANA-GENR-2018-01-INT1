\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:Introduction}

The ATLAS Physics and Committees Office (PO) is part of the ATLAS collaboration~\cite{PERF-2007-01} and is constituted of physicists and engineers performing several tasks connected to the continuous support of committees and groups such as ATLAS management, Physics Coordinators, Publication Committee chairs, Analysis Group conveners, Authorship Committee, Speakers Committee and many others. The PO also provides help to any member of the ATLAS collaboration, including helping with membership, authorship, paper submission to arXiv and journals, reviewing talks and posters to national and regional meetings.

PO also supports the development of many tools such as those used to handle the management of the Analysis, preparing and submitting the Papers, the Performance Plots and Proceedings Trackers, using Web interfaces to handle Analysis metadata and version control (Git \cite{git}) for editing documents, handling authorship and author lists. Last but not the least, PO members are always alert and available to assist the users in case they have questions or complaints about the tools and it also assists on many other daily tasks to lower the load on each member of the collaboration, including the Physics Office itself.

A dedicated organisation of the work, detector maintenance and operation, data analysis and scientific publication and outreach has been set up, as described in \cref{sec:ATLAS_work_strategy}.
Collaborative tools are thus needed to perform not only an efficient communication between the collaborators but also an easy manageable interaction with the outside world, namely the publication journals, the institutions and the funding agencies.

In this report, we focus on the Analysis and Papers infrastructure and its most recent developments launched in fall 2017, described in \cref{sec:The_FENCE_project} and \cref{sec:Analysis_and_paper_phases}.
Due to the phasing out of the SVN system~\cite{svn}, we built a new system to handle any analysis and document type (for internal use or for a large publication) using the FENCE framework  together with GitLab~\cite{gitlab}, as described in \cref{sec:PO-Gitlab_and_CI_tools}.
The FENCE--GitLab integration is described in \cref{sec:FENCE_and_Gitlab_integration}. In \cref{sec:Authorlists_Acknowledgements_and_ProofChecker}, a description of the main tools used to handle the collaboration author list and the funding and foundation agencies acknowledgements is given.
A more general description of the way we manage the metadata is presented in \cref{sec:Handling_the_metadata}.
